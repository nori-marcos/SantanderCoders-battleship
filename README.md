# Battleship
This code implements the battleship game by using JAVA language. It was proposed by the training school Let's Code.

## Description
The user plays this game against the computer. 

A player sets the desired number of ships on the game board which length equals 10. In order to hit hidden ships from the computer, the player needs to enter the coordinates in the console. On the other hand, random coordinates are generated by the computer to hit the player's ship.

Regardless of whether the player or the computer mistakenly gives repeated coordinates, the round is finished and passed to the next player.

After the player or computer has remained without undetected ships, the game ends.
